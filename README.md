## Reflection

Originally I wanted to build an application that fetches data from external api and show it to the user, I started building minimal ui components like AppTitle, AppNavLinks and cocktail cards to feed api data into it then added search functionality. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-5.2` and `tailwindcss`.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are:

- React
- React-Router-Dom 5.2
- TailwindCSS
- and a significant amount of JSX

I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
